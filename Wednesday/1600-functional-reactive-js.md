# Anas Raza - Functional Reactive JavaScript

- Things to know about functional programming
    - Separation is good
        - Pass the data in that you are going to use instead of using global varialbes
        - Mutations from Calculation
            - Don't do calculations and modifications in the same call
    - Pure functions
        - Mapping Functions 
        - Given same input, always the same output
        - Produces no side effects
    - Functional Nouns
        - Functions can be thought of as nouns
    - Functors
        - An object of data structure you can map over.
        - Can you prototype the map function on the function?
- Reactive
    - programming with async data steams
    - Push vs Pull
        - pull is calling for data and something will be returned.
        - push will wait for something to be given to it, which can happen over time, multiple times.
