# Jen Looper & TJ VanToll - Sharing Code Between Web and Native Apps

- NativeScript
- Native app users spend 18x more time on apps than mobile web
- Mobile web reaches a much larger audience
- There is no HTML, so they have some components taht will render the iOS and Android
- CSS is similar but is parsed and put into native stuff
- As long as there is no DOM code(like services) then you should be able to share that part of the codebase
- Router is just a different set of router directives
- Supports CSS animations
- Don't think of native as being JUST another version of your website, web apps can handle much more robust features
